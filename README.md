🎯 Customization

You can easily change:
	•	Text → edit opts.strings in the script
	•	Colors → modify balloon, ribbon, and firework colors
	•	Speeds & sizes → adjust firework and balloon parameters
	•	Sparkle density → tweak sparkleChance and sparkleMaxSize

⸻

🛠️ How It Works
	•	Each letter goes through 3 phases:
	1.	Firework Phase — launches upward with a sparkling trail
	2.	Contemplate Phase — letter appears glowing with an explosion of shards
	3.	Balloon Phase — heart balloon inflates and floats the letter away
	•	Animation loops endlessly for continuous celebration.
